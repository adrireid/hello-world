# hello-world

Hi Everyone! 

Adri here, I've enjoyed my career so far in Tech and can't wait to continue. I have been introduced to github prior but this is the first time I can actually say I feel comfortable about it. Be sure to come back and check out my projects as I progress thru this challenging and rewarding career. Fun fact I also enjoy graphic design so you may catch some gems along the way!
